## 6 Graph Algorithms

### 6.1 Definitions

- 

#### Undirected graph



#### Directed graph(diagraph)



#### Restrictions

- **Self loop** is illegal.
- **Multigraph** is not considered.

#### Complete graph

- A graph that has the maximum number of edges.

#### Adjacent



#### Subgraph



#### Path



#### Length of a path



#### Simple path



#### Cycle



#### Component of an undirected



#### Tree



#### DAG

- a directed acyclic graph

#### Strongly connected directed graph



#### Strongly connected component



#### Degree

- number of edges incident to v. For a directed G, we have **in-degree** and **out-degree**.

- Given G with $n$ vertices and $e$ edges, then
  $$
  e=(\sum)/2
  $$

### 6.2 Representation of Graphs

#### Adjacent Matrix



#### Adjacent Lists



#### Adjacent Multilist



#### Weighted Edges



### 6.3 Topological Sort

#### AOV Network



#### Partial order



#### [Definition] A *topological order* is a linear ordering
