### 6.5 Network Flow Problems

#### A Simple Algorithm

##### Step 1

##### Step 2

##### Step 3

##### Step 4



#### A solution



- Proposition : If the edge capabilities are **rational numbers**, this algorithm always terminate with a maximum flow.
- Note : The algorithm works for $G$ with **cycles** as well.

#### Analysis

- An augmenting path can be found by an unweighted shortest path algorithm.



### 6.5 Minimum Spanning Tree

##### [Definition] A *spanning tree* of a graph $G$ is a tree which consists of $V(G)$ and a subset of $E(G)$

- Note :

  > - The minimum spanning tree is a tree since it is acyclic, the number of edges is $|V|-1$
  > - It is minimum
  > -

1. Prim’s Algorithm
2. Kruskal’s Algorithm
